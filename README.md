### Project Overview
Cyclistic is a fictional Chicago-based bike-share company launched in 2016. Operates 5,800 geo-tracked cycles with 692 stations across Chicago.

Pricing Plans:
- Single Ride Pass
- Full Day Pass
- Annual Memberships

In this project, customers who purchase Single Ride Passes or Full Day Passes are classified as **Casual Riders**, while those with annual memberships are classified as **Members**.

This project analyses Cyclistic bike-share data using Excel Pivot Tables and Power Query. The goal is to understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently and provide actionable insights to increase annual memberships.

### Data Overview:
- Source: Data was provided by a real company for educational, research, and analysis purposes.
- Period: May 2023 to April 2024.
- Volume: 5.7 million rows of data.
- Format : .csv

### Project Objectives:
- Understand usage patterns of casual riders vs. annual members.
- Identify high-level trends in ride behavior (e.g., duration, day/time, bike type).
- Provide marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

### Tools Used:
- Power Query : For cleaning, transforming and consolidating raw data.
- Excel Pivot Tables : For creating summaries and charts.
- Excel Charts : For visualizing insights (e.g., bike type usage, average ride duration).

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task:
1. Data loading and inspections
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves exploring the data to answer the key questions such as,
- How annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
- Identify key insights to drive marketing strategies for converting casual riders.
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving ridership and revenue.

### Project Structure
- data/: Contains a sample cleaned dataset for demonstration purposes and **data_dictionary.md** file explains the structure and meaning of the datasetâ€™s columns.
- visuals/: Includes charts created using Excel.
- README.md: Provides project overview and instructions.
- LICENSE: Contains licensing terms.

### Key Insights:
The analysis key insights are summarised as follows : 
1. Bike Type Usage:
    - Casual riders prefer classic and electric bikes.
    - Members have balanced usage across all bike types.
